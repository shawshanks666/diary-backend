Diary Entry: August 30, 2024

Today was... alright, I suppose. The weather was kind of gloomy, which matched the overall tone of the day. Work was busier than usual, with a few unexpected tasks popping up here and there. I managed to get through most of it, but it felt like I was constantly playing catch-up.

Lunch was okay—nothing special. I tried out that new café nearby, but the sandwich I ordered wasn’t as good as I had hoped. Maybe it was just an off day for them. The afternoon dragged a bit, and by the time I got home, I was more tired than I expected. I wanted to relax, but even that felt a little off.

I spent the evening trying to unwind, but I couldn’t shake this sense of something being slightly out of place. It’s not like anything particularly bad happened, but I just didn’t feel entirely myself today. Maybe tomorrow will be better.
